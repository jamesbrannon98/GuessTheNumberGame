The user's first guess will turn the screen red and let the user know whether the guess is too high or too low.
Each subsequent guess with continue to let the player know if the guess is too high or too low, as well as display a red or blue screen
depending on if the current guess is closer or further from the answer in comparison to the previous guess.
When the correct number is guessed, the screen displays white and the user is informed they have correctly guessed the number.

In addition to a second text box informing the user if their guess it too high or too low, there is also a button to allow the user to start a new game.
